## Levenshtein Edit Distance ##

Used to measure the difference between two sequences.

### Example Problem ###

"The Levenshtein distance between "kitten" and "sitting" is 3, since the 
following three edits change one into the other, and there is no way to 
do it with fewer than three edits:

1. kitten → sitten (substitution of "s" for "k")
2. sitten → sittin (substitution of "i" for "e")
3. sittin → sitting (insertion of "g" at the end)."
